# Redux Road
This is my project for Codecademy's Redux Road in the Full Stack Engineer path.

## Project Description
In this project you will build an adventure game using reducers, state, and actions. The state will represent, well, the state of the game. It contains the player’s inventory, distance travelled, and time on the road. Each event in the game is represented as an action. Players can gather supplies, travel, and–if they play risky–sometimes tip over the wagon carrying their supplies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

## Usage

1. Open the `wagonGame.js` file and explore the reducer and initial state for the wagon.
2. Use the `wagonReducer` function to simulate different actions and observe how the state changes.
3. Customize and expand the game logic as you see fit to create your unique wagon adventure!
